_HBaseExplorer_ is a tool that allows to manipulate and explore HBase instances. See [documentation|http://hbase.apache.org/]
to learn more about HBase and its Data Storage Model. The Goal is to have a Administrators Utility for
maintaining the potentially huge data sets in various HBase instances. While there is a HBase Shell UI
(that can also be used to script administrative tasks), this tool shall allow to get a bit more visual
insight into the data.
